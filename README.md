### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 

- Select API for project
- Add playback functionality to display tunes
- Add like & dislike buttons
- Add list of tunes
- Make site responsive (mobile, tablet, desktop)

#### PostMVP  

- Stylize playback buttons
- Add animation
